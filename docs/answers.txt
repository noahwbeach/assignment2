    git log README.md

4. Organization and Parallel workflow

5. git log lists commits on the current branch
   git status shows the status of the current branch

6. git log Vehicle.h

7. git log --grep "file"

    I) Inheritance is the process of sharing attributes
       and methods from parent to child class

    II) Polymorphism is using inheritance to create a
        common interface where the underlying implementation
        is actually different

    III) Encapsulation is the process of guarding access
         to data inside of classes through methods
         (compared to accessing data directly)

9. Dictator and Lieutenants workflow has an additional layer
   between the developers and the blessed repository compared
   to the Integration Manager workflow

10. In the Dictator and Lieutenants workflow, conflicts are
    handled in separate repositories, which will help with keeping
    the blessed repository clean since there are 100 developers
    (100 developers committing to a single repo would get messy really fast)
